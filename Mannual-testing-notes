1.Exploratory Testing:

Explore the application, understand features identify scenarios document those scenarios based on documented scenarios 
perform Testing.
why we do exploratory testing:
When there is no requirement.
there is a requirement but not understandable.
there is req but no time for reading.
Drawbacks:
misunderstand feature as bug
Eg. company is having one login page,three fields are there username,pass and empl id we don't have req so we assume the 
empl id as bug but actually it is a feature.
misunderstand Bug as Feature
Eg .Login page is having name, email id and mobile no field if we clicked on login otp is received only on Phone no but 
req is received on mail also so we assume that it is not a bug it is a feature of an apps.
As req is missing so it is time Consuming.

In order to identify and execute the functional requirement of an application from start to finish “use case” is used and the techniques used to do this is known as “Use Case Testing.”
